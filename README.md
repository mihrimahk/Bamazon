## HOW TO USE BAMAZON

 ** Bamazon Customer

After running "bamazonCustomer.js",  first displays all of the items available for sale. This cli-table include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale.
The app  then prompt users with two messages.
*The first asks them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
*The second message  asks  how many units of the product they would like to buy.

After the customer has placed the order, this  application checks if the store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

If not, the app  log a phrase like Insufficient quantity!, and then prevent the order from going through.

However, if the store does have enough of the product, it fulfill the customer's order.
